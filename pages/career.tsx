      <h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        At Netflix, the well known video streaming service, my first role placed me on the customer service engineering
        team. On this team I found myself working on the entire customer service platform which encompassed VoIP, chat,
        CRM, CMS, and help center applications. The nature of customer service led me to build distributed applications
        handling large amounts of traffic with high availability.

        Later, I moved to the studio engineering team to find new challenges and explore a new domain. Here my primary
        focus was on content setup and readiness. I found myself working closely with stakeholders to deliver impactful
        user experiences and improve the efficiency of our tools.
